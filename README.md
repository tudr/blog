Jekyll Material Design is a colorful, beautiful theme for Jekyll user that wants material design in their jekyll blog. 

It's pretty minimal, but leverages large type and drastic contrast to make a statement, on all devices.

The Jekyll theme was crafted with <3 by [Andre Christoga](http://christoga.github.io) (@andrechristoga).

## Getting Started

If you're completely new to Jekyll, I recommend checking out the documentation at http://jekyllrb.com or there's a tutorial by Smashing Magazine.

### Installing Jekyll

If you don't have Jekyll already installed, you will need to go ahead and do that.
```
$ gem install jekyll
```

###  Verify your Jekyll version

It's important to also check your version of Jekyll.

```
$ jekyll -v
jekyll 3.0.1
```

# Installing
Install via Git

```
$ git clone https://github.com/christoga/blog.git
$ cd blog
```

### Fork, then clone

Fork the repo, and then clone it so you've got the code locally.

## Modify the `_config.yml`

The _config.yml located in the root of the Pixyll directory contains all of the configuration details for the Jekyll site. The defaults are:
```
# Site settings
title: Andre Christoga
email: andre.christoga@gmail.com
description: "Tech geek, Technologist, Frontend Dev, Developer, Nerdy Boy, Technokid!"
username: andrechristoga
baseurl: "/blog"
url: "http://christoga.github.io/blog"
paginate: 10
paginate_path: "/halaman/:num/"

# Build settings`
markdown: kramdown
permalink: pretty
gems: [jekyll-paginate]
highlighter: pygments

```
### Jekyll Serve

Then, start the Jekyll Server. I always like to give the --watch option so it updates the generated HTML when I make changes.

$ jekyll serve --watch
Now you can navigate to localhost:4000 in your browser to see the site.

Using Github Pages

You can host your Jekyll site for free with Github Pages. Click here for more information.

A configuration tweak if you're using a gh-pages sub-folder

In addition to your github-username.github.io repo that maps to the root url, you can serve up sites by using a gh-pages branch for other repos so they're available at github-username.github.io/repo-name.

This will require you to modify the _config.yml like so:

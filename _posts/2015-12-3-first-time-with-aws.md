## Introduction
I started to fall in love with code since my mom told me : “Stop playing games!, try make games, apps and website!” that was a moving time of my life.

<blockquote> from gamer to coder. </blockquote>

So I browse how to create apps, games and website, I try App Inventor for apps and games :), it was a blockly curicullum that created by google so kids would be more happy to code and dont see a boring coding text and a boring terminal line.

For site I try html but I didnt understand it :(
But now I’m pretty understand at web programming :) (learning at w3schools.com)

## Meeting AWS

So I find a news that AWS will create an event at Jakarta, so I go with my mom at the event, she was pretty shocked when she know that actually adults people who go to the show, not people like ME.

So my mom who goes in the room (not ME), my mom tell them that actually I was the one who can code.
While waiting for my mom, I plays minecraft on my phone, suddenly one of the AWS team : "Fred" come to me! :
Fred : “Hey Kid!”

Me : “Hi?”

Fred : “What are you creating right now?”

Me : (with confused face) ”Just playing minecraft :), while waiting for my mom”

Fred : “Can you make an app?”

Me : “I'm not a pro at coding, but I can create it with App Inventor” 

(Now I dont use it anymore, I use cordova, phonegap and ionic)

Fred : “Hey guys!, check out this kid, he can create an app!”

So, some AWS guys come to me and talks to me : Donnie Prakoso and others..

And Fred also challenge me to create an app :)

Since that time, I started to fall in love to code.
Now I already create coding things at GitHub : https://github.com/christoga
